## Clarification on Issue 1

The main requirement for this issue is to provide an API endpoint that allows external clients to send requests to our system. Our system should forward these requests using the provider token from our environment to the provider's API, which is already implemented and used by our UI.

### Requirements:
- The new endpoint should handle:
  - Authentication
  - Request validation
  - Response forwarding to clients
- Documentation for external clients on how to use this endpoint should be included.
