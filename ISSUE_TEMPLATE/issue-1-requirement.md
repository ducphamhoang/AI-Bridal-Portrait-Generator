## Requirement Clarification: External API Endpoint for Image Generation

**Objective:**  
Develop one or more API endpoints that allow external clients (such as partner applications or third-party services) to request image generation from our system. When an external client sends a request, our system will forward this request to the appropriate image generation provider’s API (using the provider token from our environment variables). The provider’s API is already integrated and used internally by our system’s UI.

### Key Features & Flow

1. **API Endpoint(s) for Clients:**  
   - Create at least one (or possibly two) HTTP POST endpoints that are publicly accessible for authorized clients.
   - Each endpoint may represent a specific image generation provider (for example, `/api/generate/providerA` and `/api/generate/providerB`) to keep routing simple and explicit.

2. **Request Handling:**  
   - The endpoint(s) should accept POST requests containing all necessary information (such as image parameters, user details, etc.) required to initiate image generation.
   - The request payload structure should be clearly documented for client developers.

3. **Provider Selection:**  
   - If clients need to choose between providers, either:
     - Provide separate endpoints for each provider, or
     - Accept a parameter in the request to specify the provider.
   - For simplicity and clarity, separate endpoints are recommended.

4. **Request Validation:**  
   - Validate incoming requests to ensure all required data is present and correctly formatted.
   - Handle authentication/authorization if needed (e.g., API keys, tokens).
   - Return clear error responses for invalid requests.

5. **Forwarding to Provider:**  
   - On receiving a valid request, the system will forward this request to the chosen provider’s API.
   - Use provider-specific tokens or credentials, which are securely stored in environment variables.
   - Handle any required translation of request data formats between our API and the provider’s API.

6. **Response Handling:**  
   - Receive the response from the provider’s API.
   - Forward the relevant response data back to the external client.
   - Properly handle and relay errors from the provider.

7. **Documentation:**  
   - Provide clear and thorough API documentation for external clients.
   - Documentation should include:
     - Endpoint URLs and HTTP methods
     - Required headers and authentication
     - Request payload structure (with examples)
     - Possible responses (success and error cases)
     - Example use cases

---

**Summary:**  
You are building a gateway API for external clients, which relays their requests to the correct image generation provider and returns the results. The system ensures that clients don’t interact with the provider directly, but instead go through your unified and documented API.
